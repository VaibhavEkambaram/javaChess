# vaibhavChess
 
A chess engine i worked on in my spare time. The program allows for 2 players to play chess, or one player to play against a computer controlled player. Some of the earlier parts of this program, such as the MinMax AI are based on the Youtube tutorials made by Amir Afghani (https://github.com/amir650).
